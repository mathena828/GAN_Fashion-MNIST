# Fashion Synthesis with Generative Adversarial Networks

Research into Generative Adversarial Networks as a tool to amplify human creativity has grown leaps and bounds in the last few years. This project explores one such application of this technology. Three state-of-the-art models are used to simulate the fashion design process. Namely, these are the Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network, the Conditional Generative Adversarial Network, and the Information Maximizing Generative Adversarial Network. A comparative analysis is done based on the quality of the images generated by each architecture. The unique features of each one are also evaluated for both supervised and unsupervised learning. Experimental results prove the feasibility of using the foregoing networks for fashion image synthesis.
